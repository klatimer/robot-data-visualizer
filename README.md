# Robot Data Visualizer
Welcome to our GitHub repository!

This project was started with the intention of providing an easy tool for
visualizing robotics data. Currently, only the University of Michigan's
NCLT data set is used, which can be found here: http://robots.engin.umich.edu/nclt/

* PRETTY PICTURE HERE (get people excited to run this thing)

## Getting Started
* Setup instructions should go here. Virtualenv, requirements.txt, setup.py, etc.
* Also @Hao we need to add Sphinx to our dependencies

## Overview
* Describe features and how to use the program. Map, GPS, lidar viewing 
tutorial.

## Documentation
To generate the project's documentation, open up a terminal from the project root
directory and type `cd doc`

Then, to generate the documentation type:
`make html` and open the `index.html` file in `_build/html`.
